# bitcore
Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, which is the underlying technology that powers the Bitcoin network
It is open-source software that is maintained by a group of volunteer developers and is available for anyone to use and contribute to.

Bitcoin Core includes a full node implementation, which means it maintains a complete copy of the Bitcoin blockchain and verifies all transactions according to the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. This allows users to independently verify the validity of all transactions on the network and ensures that no one can manipulate the blockchain.
